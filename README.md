### Hey, I'm Charlie! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜ƒ

_Pronouns: She/Her_

I'm currently a Senior frontend developer @Netlify, where I work on the UI for the [Netlify app](https://app.netlify.com).

I am passionate about human-computer interaction so, on my personal time, I build lots of interactive prototypes using machine learning, hardware, creative coding, AR/VR, most of it in JavaScript!

You can check all my projects on [my website](https://charliegerard.dev).

I regularly speak at conferences to share things I learn and build, and I'm also the author of a [book on machine learning for web developers with TensorFlow.js](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484264171)! ðŸ“š
